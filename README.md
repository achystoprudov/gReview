gReview - The Bamboo Gerrit Integration Plugin
==============================================

This plugin polls Gerrit for changes submitted to the Gerrit review system. 
When a new change is submitted, gReview will checkout the change and verify
it builds. gReview will update the Gerrit change to reflect the correct score
for a successful or unsuccessful build.

 * GitWeb Integration.
 * Builds and Verifies Changes Submitted to Gerrit.
 * Changes are built independently in the order they are submitted.
 * Change dependencies are resolved naturally through Gerrit PatchSets.

 * Git submodule support
 * Remote trigger builds from Gerrit.
 * [All the Features Provided By Bamboo](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/)

Usage
=======

Setup Gerrit
------------

 * Login as admin.
 * Select 'Configure Plan' under 'Actions' in the dropdown menu on the right.
 * Select the 'Source Repositoryies' Tab.
 * [Select 'Add Repository'.](https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/111679711947778743513/albums/5751797380554349169/5754399119605434834)
 
Optional Gerrit Branch Configuration
------------------------------------

By default, gReview is configured to draw down changes from Gerrit using the 
master branch. If you choose, you may overide this setting and configure to
poll all branches or a specific custom branch. However, keep in mind, this
setting may be redundant if you use Bamboo's branching features. If you
choose to overide the default branch, you will find the settings available
here:

 * Login as admin.
 * Select 'Configure Plan' under 'Actions' in the dropdown menu on the right.
 * Select the 'Source Repositoryies' Tab.
 * Select the repository you intend to configure.
 * If the repository is 'linked', follow the link to your repository.
 * Goto 'Advanced options'
 * Under 'Default Branch', select master, 'All branches', or specify your custom branch.
 * Save

Enable Gerrit Verification
--------------------------

 * Login as admin.
 * Select 'Plan Configuration' under 'Actions' in the dropdown menu on the right.
 * Select the 'Stages' Tab.
 * Select the job you're interested in. Usually there is only one, 'Default Job'.
 * Under the job configuration, select the "Miscellaneous" tab.
 * Check ['Run Gerrit Verification after main build.'](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oawKtjfHbbo/T9J9PgwUF9I/AAAAAAAAANU/C0kOBQYFkC8/s1303/gerritConfig2.JPG)

Viewing Gerrit Change Information

Gerrit change information is available under the Build Summary [Gerrit Tab](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k0Oy_CnsufA/T9J9PglbtTI/AAAAAAAAANM/vPKpt8nsgUY/s785/gerritTab.JPG)

Adding Gitweb
-------------

Creating A Branch (Gerrit UI)

 * Hit 'Create Branch'

Creating A Branch (Git Console)
-------------------------------

 * git push origin HEAD:new-branch
 * git checkout new-branch
 * git push origin HEAD:refs/for/new-branch

Troubleshooting
===============

Connection Issues
-----------------

Make sure you have Gerrit setup correctly with SSH identity key generated and 
host used in the SSH connection string added to known host. Detailed instructions 
are available in the [Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/install-quick.html#usersetup).

**Note**: Some builds will still hang in native msysgit mode on Windows due to 
the following issue with the bamboo-git-plugin: [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11096](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11096).
        
You can work around this issue by manually adding your hostname, used in the 
repository configuration, to the msysgit/.ssh/known_hosts file. Example:

> 127.0.0.1 ssh-rsa XXXXB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABBBBgQC699HzXHwr1H6OJeVlRo7h4r+3PY
> d0wNkqzl6EUAeU2iZjqFqQL2ZiNVqs2JrpTNadbgtXBNk9rhQIWajQZG9ZJG/OPxe+NOkbWQVev
> rcELsw5N2wxcJOWz+ey1tFv3VCtNCLUGgF7yIg0kZZVQ+HvAzLoMbiHs0haVmEjnLherSw==

NullPointerException Encountered after Upgrade
----------------------------------------------

If this is an upgrade, and you encouter a NullException when attempting to 
build, you may need to resave your repository settings.Release 1.2.3 changed 
the way the ssh private key is stored for multiple repositories. Resaving 
should resolve this issue.

Unable to Delete Repository
---------------------------

This is an old issue and has been fixed in new releases of Bamboo. Here's the 
[ticket](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11377).

Debugging
---------

If problems persist, you can turn on debugging in the Administration console to
help resolve and report issues. Steps to turn on debugging:

 * Goto Administration->System->Log Settings
 * Add com.houghtonassociates.bamboo.plugins=DEBUG
 
Check your Bamboo home directory for log output:

Ex: bamboo-home\logs\atlassian-bamboo.log
